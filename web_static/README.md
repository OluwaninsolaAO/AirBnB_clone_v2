# Web Static

Making the command line interpreter come to live in webbased
environment required a web interface to present whatever is
being fed by the interpreter.

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build
the front end step-by-step. The first step is to “design” / “sketch”
 / “prototype” each element:

+ Create simple HTML static pages
+ Style guide
+ Fake contents
+ No Javascript
+ No data loaded from anything

During this project, the how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages were
explored. HTML will form the structure of the page, it will be the
first thing to write. CSS will be used in the styling page, the design.

Happy viewing!
